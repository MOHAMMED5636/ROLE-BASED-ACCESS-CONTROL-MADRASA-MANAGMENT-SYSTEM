# ROLE-BASED-ACCESS-CONTROL-MADRASA-MANAGMENT-SYSTEM
In the Madarasa Management System, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) ensures that users have appropriate access based on their roles. Admins manage system settings, teachers handle student records, parents access their child's progress, and students view personal data. This approach secures data by restricting permissions.

This is a comprehensive Madarsa Management System designed to manage and streamline operations at a madarsa. The application is developed with different modules for admins, parents, teachers, and students to effectively manage their roles and responsibilities.
